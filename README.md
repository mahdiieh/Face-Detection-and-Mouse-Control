# Face-Detection-and-Mouse-Control
This Python script uses OpenCV and PyAutoGUI libraries to capture real-time video feed, detect faces and eyes using Haar cascades, and control the mouse pointer based on the position of the detected face on the screen.

<b>Features</b>:

<b>1)Face and Eye Detection:</b> 
  Utilizes pre-trained Haar cascades to detect faces and eyes from the webcam feed.
  
<b>2)Mouse Control:</b> 
  Moves the mouse pointer based on the position of the detected face relative to the screen.
  
<b>3)Real-Time Video Feed:</b> 
  Continuously captures and processes video frames to update face and eye positions.
  
<b>Dependencies:</b>

    OpenCV (cv2)
    PyAutoGUI (pyautogui)
